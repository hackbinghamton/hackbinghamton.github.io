On behalf of the HackBU team, I am excited to announce that [signups for the HackBU 2024 hackathon](https://forms.gle/NpJnaMxDfLvCcywb9) are now open! This event will take place on **February 17th–18th, in-person at Binghamton University's Innovative Technology Complex**. Regular registration will close at 11:59PM on February 12th, so register soon!

<!--more-->

The hackathon is a 24-hour "innovation marathon" in which you and your team of 1–4 students build a project from the ground up in the language and technology of your choosing. We highly recommend that students of all backgrounds get involved, regardless of skill level! If you feel unconfident programming, we will be hosting workshops that go over programming with Python and creating websites with HTML and CSS.

Thanks to our sponsors, we will be providing free food and free swag to all of our attendees (this year's swag color is cardinal red!). There will also be many opportunities to network and attend talks from our affiliates.
