Hi all! [HackBU 2024](https://hackbu.org/2024/) is on Saturday, so let's talk details about the event :)

<!--more-->

## Late Registration

Regular Registration ended earlier this week, but we are still happy to take [late registrations](https://forms.gle/s3Bi82F8LgXc1fj86)! We will also be able to accomodate walk-on registrations. If you're on the fence, I highly recommend registering - it doesn't hurt to save a seat, and showing up to the hackathon will be well worth your time.

## Schedule and Location

The schedule for the hackathon has been published at [https://hackbu.org/2024/schedule](https://hackbu.org/2024/schedule). Any last-minute changes (i.e. due to delays on the day-of) will be published to our [Discord server](/discord). All participants, judges, and sponsors should join the Discord server to stay up-to-date.

The event locations given on that schedule are all rooms within the [Innovative Technology Complex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GMq2cioxjg2yRB5r6) (ITC). Here's the map for this year:

Notice how check-in is in a different spot this time. To enter HackBU, you must go through the main entrance of the Engineering & Science building:

## Transportation

I'll cut to the chase: no OCCT shuttle this year. But, don't worry! We are doing everything we can to make sure that you have options to get to the hackathon.

Firstly, we will be having a walking group at 11:00AM and 11:30AM on Saturday that start in the lobby of the University Union, and end at the ITC. It's a [20 minute walk through campus](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Eu9ZBKTst54WMidJ7), but it goes by quickly. And, remember, this used to be the only way to get to HackBU without a car :^)

Secondly, we are allocating a $1k+ travel fund for anyone who needs to use Uber or Lyft to get to the event. You can check out [our reimbursement form](https://forms.gle/4SnRseHa3J9Htq5t7) to see the terms!

## Other Stuff

The [Devpost](https://hackbu2024.devpost.com/) is now up! The theme for the hackathon is "Hack Tomorrow", and we have the following prize categories:

- #1/#2/#3 Best Hack: Overall best project.
- Best Technical Hack: Best project from the perspective of being technically impressive.
- Best Newbie Hack: Best project made by a team where at least half of the members have not done a hackathon before.
- Best Harpur Hack: Best project made by a team where at least half of the members are Harpur students (not including dual-degree students in Watson, sorry!).

We hope to see you at the hackathon! If there are any further questions, ping me on Discord or shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:hello@hackbu.org">hello@hackbu.org</a> :)
