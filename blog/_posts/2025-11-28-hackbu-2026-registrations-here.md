Registrations for HackBU 2026 are now open! This 24-hour event in Binghamton's Innovative Technology Complex is set for March 7th and 8th, when university students will compete in teams of 1−4 to build the most impressive project within that time. Besides a chance to exercise your programming and project management skills, this is also a great chance to network with our sponsors and with other students. Our programming features crash-courses for newcomers, team-matching, and an award ceremony with prizes in multiple categories.
