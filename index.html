	<h3 class="article-title">What are these workshops?</h3>
	<p>We host <a href="/schedule">weekly workshops</a> on campus to help teach web and mobile development. You'll learn at your own pace, and we'll provide the resources to help you do it. We're there to answer questions, help you work through tough problems, and generally around to get you pumped up about learning to code.

	<h3 class="article-title">What's a hackathon?</h3>
	<p>An event where "hackers" come together in teams with the intention of creating the best type of program (i.e. web app, iPhone app, etc.) or hardware project within a certain period of time. Most hackathons last between 24-48 hours and are full of caffeine, food, prizes, and little sleep.</p>

<div class="article">
	<h3 class="article-title">Is experience necessary?</h3>
	<p>Not at all! Many HackBU members have no programming experience.</p>

	<p>We recommend attending our weekly workshops, but also take a look at our <a href="/resources/">resources page</a> which will point you in the right direction. We're happy to help!</p>
